# Spark
#### A Launcher for Dark Ages Clients

#### Summary
Spark is a graphical application that provides additional options when launching <a href="http://www.darkages.com">Dark Ages</a> clients. These options include redirecting the client to a custom server hostname/port, skipping the intro video, allowing multiple instances, and hiding foreground walls.

#### Language and Framework
Spark is a WPF application written in C# using Visual Studio 2013 (Community Edition). It targets version 4.5.1 of the .NET Framework and implements a simple MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

#### Client Version Support
Spark currently supports <strong>version 7.39</strong> of the official Dark Ages game client. Previous clients may also be supported, though their support is not guaranteed. You may edit the generated <strong>Versions.xml</strong> file to support additional client versions.
